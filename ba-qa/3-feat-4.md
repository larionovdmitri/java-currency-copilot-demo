### Feature 4: Document Upload

#### Overview
This feature enables users to upload necessary documentation to support their Medicare enrollment application. It's crucial to ensure that the upload process is user-friendly, secure, and capable of handling various file formats and sizes.

#### User ideas and Technical Details

**User Story 1 (Happy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to upload necessary documents to complete my enrollment.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Users can upload files such as proof of age and residency.
  - The system provides feedback on the upload progress.
  - A confirmation message appears once the upload is successful.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Implement a file upload component using Angular that supports drag-and-drop and standard file selection.
  - Use Angular services to manage the upload process and handle the communication with backend APIs.
  - Provide real-time feedback using progress bars or similar UI elements.

**User Story 2 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to be informed if my uploaded file is in the wrong format.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system checks the file format during the upload process and rejects unsupported formats.
  - A clear error message specifies the acceptable file formats.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Validate file types on the client side using Angular before sending to the server.
  - Implement server-side validation as a backup to ensure security and correctness.

**User Story 3 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to know if my uploaded file exceeds the size limit.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system checks the file size upon selection and before uploading.
  - Users are warned if the file exceeds the maximum allowed size with suggestions for reducing the file size or selecting a different file.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Implement client-side checks for file size using Angular.
  - Configure server-side validation to ensure no oversized files are processed, which could impact system performance.

#### Design and UI/UX Tasks
- **Task 1**: Design a clear and intuitive interface for the document upload feature, incorporating elements like icons, tooltips, and instructional text to guide users.
- **Task 2**: Create responsive design elements for the upload interface to ensure it is accessible on various devices, especially for users who may prefer mobile devices.
- **Task 3**: Ensure that error messages and feedback are displayed in a friendly and helpful manner to reduce frustration and confusion.

#### Development Tasks
- **Task 1**: Implement the frontend functionality for handling file uploads, including user feedback and error handling.
- **Task 2**: Develop backend API endpoints to receive and store documents securely, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations like HIPAA.
- **Task 3**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend components to ensure functionality and robustness.

#### QA Engineering Tasks
- **Task 1**: Develop test cases to cover all functional scenarios including file format and size validations.
- **Task 2**: Perform security testing to validate that the document upload feature does not expose the system to vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or data leaks.
- **Task 3**: Conduct accessibility and usability testing to ensure that the document upload process is clear and accessible to all users, including those with limited tech-savvy.

This structured and detailed approach for the Document Upload feature ensures that the Medicare enrollment process is efficient, secure, and user-friendly. The system's reliability and compliance with necessary regulations are paramount, and thorough testing and quality assurance are critical to achieving these goals.
