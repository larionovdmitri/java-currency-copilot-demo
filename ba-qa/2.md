### Testing and Quality Assurance
For each user story, quality assurance engineers will need to create test cases that validate both the happy path and each unhappy path. They should also consider edge cases, such as:

- Interruptions in internet connectivity during submission.
- Cross-browser compatibility for the web form.

Each of these scenarios helps ensure that the Medicare enrollment form is user-friendly, robust, and reliable before going live.
