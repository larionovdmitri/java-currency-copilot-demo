### Feature 5: Review and Submit

#### Overview
This final feature allows users to review all the information and documents they've entered and uploaded before submitting their Medicare enrollment application. It is crucial for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the application and provides users with one last opportunity to make any necessary adjustments.

#### User Stories and Technical Details

**User Story 1 (Happyus Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to review all my entered information and submit my enrollment form.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - A summary page displays all information entered and documents uploaded during previous steps.
  - Users can navigate back to any section to make edits.
  - The "Submit" button is enabled only when all required information is complete and validated.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Use Angular routing to allow users to revisit previous sections of the form without losing current data.
  - Implement a summary component that dynamically aggregates data from all steps for final review.
  - Enhance state management to ensure data integrity throughout the navigation and editing process.

**User Story 2 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to be able to edit my information from the review page if I notice any mistakes.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Provide "Edit" buttons next to each section of information on the review page.
  - Ensure that navigating back to edit does not cause loss of any previously entered information.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Implement robust state management with services like NgRx or simple Angular services to keep track of changes across different form sections.
  - Use Angular guards to prevent accidental navigation away from the page without saving changes.

**User Story 3 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback if my submission fails.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - In case of submission failure, display a clear and informative error message.
  - Provide guidance or actions the user can take to resolve the submission issue.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Handle backend errors effectively and display relevant messages to the user.
  - Implement retry logic for transient issues and provide users with the option to try submitting again.

#### Design and UI/UX Tasks
- **Task 1**: Design a comprehensive and clear summary page that allows easy review of all data and documents.
- **Task 2**: Ensure that the review page and the edit functionality are intuitive, particularly for users who are not as familiar with digital forms.
- **Task 3**: Design error messages and failure notifications to be empathetic and helpful, guiding users towards resolution without causing frustration.

#### Development Tasks
- **Task 1**: Develop the review and submission components using Angular, ensuring seamless navigation and data management.
- **Task 2**: Set up secure and robust API endpoints for the final form submission, ensuring that all data is handled securely in compliance with regulations.
- **Task 3**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms to address any issues during form submission.

#### QA Engineering Tasks
- **Task 1**: Create detailed test scenarios to cover the review process, edits, and final submission, including error handling.
- **Task 2**: Automate testing for navigation and data persistence across different sections of the form.
- **Task 3**: Conduct stress testing and performance testing to ensure the system remains responsive and reliable under load.

By detailing each step of the Review and Submit feature, the project ensures a smooth and reliable end-user experience. This careful planning helps prevent errors in the application process and increases user confidence in the system, ultimately leading to successful Medicare enrollopment.
