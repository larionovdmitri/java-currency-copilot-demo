### Feature 1: Personal Information Collection

#### Overview
This feature involves the collection of personal information from the user, which is crucial for identity verification and subsequent steps in the Medicare enrollment process. The interface needs to be intuitive, secure, and capable of handling various user inputs accurately.

#### User Stories and Technical Details

**User Story 1 (Happy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to enter my personal information to verify my identity.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Input fields for name, age, date of birth, and address are provided.
  - Each field has proper validation: text fields disallow numbers and symbols, age and date fields require numeric inputs, and address fields validate against a standard format.
  - The form does not submit until all fields pass validation checks.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Use Angular forms with built-in and custom validators.
  - Implement reactive forms to manage state and validations dynamically.
  - Utilize Angular Material components for UI consistency and responsiveness.

**User Story 2 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to receive an error message if I enter invalid data.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Error messages are specific to the type of validation failure (e.g., "Invalid characters in name", "Age must be a number").
  - Errors are displayed immediately after the field loses focus (on blur event).
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Enhance Angular validators with custom error messages.
  - Use asynchronous validators for complex validations that might require API calls (e.g., checking uniqueness of an identifier).

**User Story 3 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to know if any required fields are missing before submission.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Required fields are clearly marked.
  - Form submission is disabled until all required fields are filled correctly.
  - Visual feedback (e.g., field border in red) is provided for incomplete fields.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Use Angular's form control properties to check the status of the form before enabling the submission button.
  - Implement custom directives to highlight incomplete or incorrect fields.

#### Design and UI/UX Tasks
- **Task 1**: Design input fields that are accessible and visually clear, using a consistent theme that aligns with the overall application.
- **Task 2**: Create error message designs that are non-intrusive but clear, possibly using tooltips or small text below each field.
- **Task 3**: Ensure the form layout is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes, considering both mobile and desktop users.

#### Development Tasks
- **Task 1**: Set up the Angular project structure and install necessary packages like Angular Material.
- **Task 2**: Develop the form using Angular Reactive Forms, integrating validators for each field.
- **Task 3**: Write unit tests for each validator and form state changes to ensure stability and reliability.

#### QA Engineering Tasks
- **Task 1**: Prepare test cases that cover all paths, including field validations, form submission, and error handling.
- **Task 2**: Automate form interaction tests using tools like Protractor or Cypress.
- **Task 3**: Conduct cross-browser testing to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

By approaching the "Personal Information Collection" feature with detailed planning and a clear distribution of tasks among the design, development, and QA teams, the project can ensure a strong foundation for user interaction within the Medicare enrollment application. This meticulous approach will help streamline the development process, enhance user experience, and ensure robust functionality.
