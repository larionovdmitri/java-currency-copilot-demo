### Feature 3: Plan Selection

#### Overview
After verifying eligibility, users are allowed to choose a Medicare plan that best suits their needs. This feature involves presenting various plan options clearly and assisting users in making an informed choice.

#### User Stories and Technical Details

**User Story 1 (Happy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to select a Medicare plan from a list of available options.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Display a list of available Medicare plans with essential information such as benefits, costs, and coverage details.
  - Allow users to select a plan using an intuitive interface such as dropdowns or radio buttons.
  - Provide a confirmation step where the user can review their selection before finalizing.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Use Angular components to create a dynamic list of plan options fetched from an API.
  - Implement interactive elements like modals or expandable lists for detailed information on each plan.
  - Utilize state management to remember user selections and facilitate easy changes if necessary.

**User Story 2 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to be able to change my plan selection before final submission if I make a mistake.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can navigate back to the plan selection screen from later stages of the enrollment process.
  - Ensure the previously selected plan is highlighted if the user returns to make a change.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Implement routing and state preservation strategies to allow users to return to the plan selection step without losing previous inputs.
  - Use Angular's data-binding features to ensure that user selections are accurately displayed across all navigation steps.

#### Design and UI/UX Tasks
- **Task 1**: Design the plan selection interface to accommodate various levels of detail in an accessible and easy-to-navigate manner.
- **Task 2**: Create interactive tooltips or help icons that provide additional information about each plan without cluttering the main interface.
- **Task 3**: Ensure the interface is responsive, adjusting seamlessly across devices and screen sizes to accommodate the likely older user base.

#### Development Tasks
- **Task 1**: Develop Angular services to fetch and handle Medicare plan data from a backend API.
- **Task 2**: Implement a responsive UI for plan selection using Angular Material components.
- **Task 3**: Write unit tests for the data handling logic and the UI components to ensure reliability and functionality.

#### QA Engineering Tasks
- **Task 1**: Create test cases that cover all aspects of the plan selection process, including data fetching, user interaction, and navigation.
- **Task 2**: Perform usability testing with a focus on accessibility, particularly considering the needs of older adults.
- **Task 3**: Conduct performance testing to ensure the interface loads efficiently even with potentially large datasets.

By following this detailed approach for the Plan Selection feature, the project team can ensure that users are able to make informed decisions in a user-friendly environment, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction with the Medicare enrollment process.
