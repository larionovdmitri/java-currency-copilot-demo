### Feature 2: Eligibility Verification

#### Overview
This feature ensures that the user is eligible for Medicare by verifying their details against an external eligibility API. Itâ€™s crucial for streamlining the enrollment process and ensuring that only qualified individuals proceed to the next steps.

#### User Stories and Technical Details

**User Story 1 (Happy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want the system to check my eligibility automatically using my personal details.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Upon form submission, the system automatically sends the necessary data to an external eligibility verification API.
  - The user receives real-time feedback on their eligibility status.
  - If eligible, the user proceeds to the plan selection feature.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Integrate an external API for eligibility verification.
  - Use Angular services to manage API calls.
  - Handle API responses with appropriate user feedback messages.

**User Story 2 (Unhappy Path):**
- **Description**: As a user, I want to know why my eligibility was not verified if there is a failure.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system provides detailed error messages if eligibility cannot be verified.
  - Suggestions or actions the user can take to resolve the issue are provided.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Implement error handling in the API integration to catch and display specific error messages.
  - Design a user-friendly error message display that guides users on next steps or corrections.

#### Design and UI/UX Tasks
- **Task 1**: Design a seamless transition between personal information submission and eligibility feedback to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Task 2**: Create UI components for displaying eligibility results and error messages in an informative and non-disruptive manner.
- **Task 3**: Ensure that the designs are accessible, especially for older users who are the primary beneficiaries of Medicare.

#### Development Tasks
- **Task 1**: Develop an Angular service to handle the eligibility verification API calls.
- **Task 2**: Securely transmit user data to the API and handle responses appropriately within the application.
- **Task 3**: Implement robust error handling to manage different scenarios of API failures or user data issues.

#### QA Engineering Tasks
- **Task 1**: Develop test cases that cover successful eligibility verification, API failure scenarios, and user data validation errors.
- **Task 2**: Use mock services to simulate API responses for thorough testing of the integration.
- **Task 3**: Perform security testing to ensure that user data is transmitted securely and that the system is resilient against common vulnerabilities.

This detailed approach for the Eligibility Verification feature ensures that both functional and non-functional requirements are thoroughly addressed. The collaboration between design, development, and QA teams will help deliver a reliable and user-friendly feature that accurately verifies user eligibility for Medicare.
